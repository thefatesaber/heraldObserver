Herald Observer - Changelog
============================

Version 1.1.0 - Persistence, Polish, and Slash Commands
--------------------------------------------------------

SavedVariables Support (New!):
- The addon now remembers your settings across game sessions:
  • Dropdown selection ("self", "target", "party", "raid")
  • Clamp to screen checkbox state
  • Main frame position
  • Minimap button position (angle)

Slash Command:
- Added `/herald` to toggle the UI at any time without needing to click the minimap button.

UI Improvements:
- Checkbox now uses the correct template (`UICheckButtonTemplate`) for full compatibility and consistent visuals.
- Dragging the main frame now saves its position dynamically.
- Dropdown choice is restored properly on load.

Minimap Button Upgrade:
- Dragging around the minimap updates and saves icon position.
- Clicking it toggles the main Herald Observer UI.
- Uses shared SavedVariables (`HeraldObserverDB`) for unified settings storage.

Codebase Enhancements:
- Extracted helper functions for better logic modularity (e.g., `getChatType`, `getGearValidity`)
- Removed redundant logic blocks
- Encapsulated position-saving logic
- Added readable structure, forward compatibility, and cleaner startup behavior

Fully backwards compatible with version 1.0.0 users


Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release
-------------------------------

Main Features:
- Added the core functionality to validate player gear eligibility for the "Herald of the Titans" achievement.

Gear Validation:
- Scans the equipped gear of your current target.
- Validates each item based on:
  • Item Level ≤ 107
  • Expansion restriction: must be from Wrath of the Lich King or earlier

Output Options:
- Allows users to choose how the gear check results are shared:
  • Self (local chat only)
  • Target (whisper to the player)
  • Party
  • Raid

Interface:
- Created a dedicated, movable UI frame with:
  • Title and instructions
  • Dropdown menu for selecting output destination
  • Clamp to screen checkbox
  • “Observe” button to initiate scan

Minimap Button:
- Added a custom, movable minimap button for fast access to the main frame.
- Button uses custom logo texture.
- Clicking the icon toggles the UI window.

Known Limitations:
- No slash command yet (/herald)
- Settings (frame position, dropdown selection) are not yet persistent
- Checkbox uses incorrect template (`BackdropTemplate`) — may not render properly in all clients
